# Web-Dev-Final

Most of my code is in the src/components/ folder. I wanted to use a word api to get the words for the game but didn't have enough time so I just found a file of 10,000 words and turned it into a list myself. I know this isn't an art class but I spent a quarter of my time on making the drawings so it looked like the game was being played on a whiteboard and I'm very pleased with how they look. It's surprising how hard it is to make something your drawing by hand look hand drawn.
